The default tool settings generate daily outputs of flow, water temperature, and nutrient levels at the mouth of La Tordera River between July 2019 and December 2020, allowing for an assessment of river flow parameters during Storm Gloria (19 January 2020). The model is executed using SWATrunR ( https://github.com/chrisschuerz/SWATplusR ) with the SWAT+ rev60.5.7_64rel_linux executable."

The output category specifies the type of data: wb (water balance), nb (nutrient balance), ls (losses), pw (plant and weather), or sd (streamflow and sediment in channels). The time step indicates the temporal resolution and can be day (daily), mon (monthly), yr (yearly), or aa (annual average). Combining these elements forms the output file name.
